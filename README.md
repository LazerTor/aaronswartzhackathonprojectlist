## How do list my project?
Simply make a pull request with your changes and I'll approve it and add it to the jottit site!

## Why Jottit?
Jottit, besides being one of Aaron's y-combinator projects, is nice because it is formatted in Markdown, meaning that contributors only need to write plain text rather than HTML to add their projects to the list

## How do I write Markdown?
Either try making your own jottit site and use the What You See Is What You Get editor to play around with the formatting before submitting your pull request or read up on it here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
